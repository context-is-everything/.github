# Contributing to Context is Everything

Thanks for your interest in contributing! Whether it's a new agent skill, a bug fix, or a feature idea, we appreciate the help.

## Ways to Contribute

- **Agent Skills** — Build and share skills in the [skills](https://github.com/context-is-everything/skills) repo
- **Bug Reports** — Open an issue with steps to reproduce
- **Feature Ideas** — Open an issue describing the use case and proposed solution
- **Documentation** — Improvements to READMEs, guides, and examples

## Getting Started

1. Fork the relevant repository
2. Create a branch for your change (`git checkout -b my-change`)
3. Make your changes and commit with a clear message
4. Push to your fork and open a Pull Request

## Pull Request Guidelines

- Keep PRs focused — one change per PR where possible
- Write a clear description of what the change does and why
- Follow existing code style and conventions in the repo
- Include any relevant tests or documentation updates

## Communication

- Be kind, constructive, and patient
- Assume good intent — if something is unclear, ask before reacting
- Give feedback on ideas, not people
- If you disagree, explain your reasoning respectfully

## Skill Contributions

For the `skills` repo specifically:

- Each skill should have a clear README explaining what it does

- Test your skill before submitting
